# Welcome to my Blog!

Hello! Welcome to my blog where I'll talk about projects I'm working on and other random stuff I find interesting!

## A bit about me

I'm a student at Tesla STEM High School who's interested in full stack development, ML, and entrepreneurship. I'm a hacker at heart, and love building side projects during weekends, and have attended over a dozen hackathons to date!

## Some projects I'm working on

- [Kobra](https://github.com/kobra-dev) -- A visual programming language (like Scratch) for Machine Learning
- [Conch](https://github.com/pranavnt/Conch) -- Store your shell scripts in the cloud and run them anywhere (npx for shell scripts)!
- [Walla](https://github.com/pranavnt/Walla) -- An intuitive, fast web framework for building APIs in Node - [My Blog](https://github.com/pranavnt/blog) -- A minimalistic markdown blog built in Next.js
- [Landing UI](https://github.com/pranavnt/landing-ui) -- React Components for building landing pages quickly

## Other Stuff about Me

I love listening to podcasts in my spare time, my favorite podcasts being the Lex Fridman Podcast, Yang Speaks, and the Joe Rogan Experience. Additionally, I enjoy going on runs on nearby trails and spending time with Chewie, my dog.

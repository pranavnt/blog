# Join Kobra!

## Basic Information about Kobra

Kobra is an open-source visual programming language (like Scratch) for Machine Learning! The purpose of this project is to take what Scratch has done for programming (removed the technical barrier) and to apply it to ML. If you're interested in full stack development, ML, education, or CS you'd be a perfect fit for our team!
